# Children's Books Minimum Age Predictor

## The motivation for the project:

Ordering children's books online can be difficult. You basically only make a purchase by reading the book's description. The problem is, that won't necessarily tell you if the book is appropriate for your young child, and sometimes an age range isn't enough. A book geared towards ages 2â€“99 for example? Is it really appropriate for a two year old? How about a six year old?

## Necessary Packages:

1. numpy 
2. pandas
3. re
4. nltk 
5. sklearn
6. plotly
7. PIL
8. Wordcloud

## An explanation of the files in the repository:
The repository includes one database, a Kaggle database of recommended children's books including title, description, and age range.
